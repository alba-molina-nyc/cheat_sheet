# While Loops

- general looping statement
  - the while can imitate the for loop but it may be slower and also takes more code

# For Loops

- to iterate through iterable objects
  - lists, tuples, strings)

## break

is used to exit the loop

## continue

is used to bring the code block to the top of the loop

## else

will be run once the loop is exiting, if the loop exists normally (without running a break)
